    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>Indian Naan is a leavened, oven-baked or tawa-fried flatbread, that can also be baked in a tandoor. It is characterized by a light and fluffy texture and golden-brown spots from the baking process.</p>

    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>⅔ cup warm water (110 degrees F/45 degrees C)</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon active dry yeast</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon white sugar</li>
        <li>2 cups all-purpose flour</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon salt</li>
        <li>2 tablespoons plain yogurt</li>
        <li>¼ cup ghee</li>
        <li>2 teaspoons kalonji (onion seed)</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Whisk warm water with yeast and sugar until yeast is dissolved. Cover and let stand in a warm place for 10 minutes.</li>

        <li>Sift flour and salt three times into a large bowl. Add yeast mixture, yogurt, and 1/2 of the ghee. Mix into a soft dough, then knead on a floured surface until dough is smooth and elastic, about 5 minutes. Place dough into a large greased bowl, cover, and let stand in a warm place for 1 1/2 hours or until doubled in volume.</li>
        <li>Punch down dough, then knead for 5 minutes. Divide dough into six equal pieces. Roll each piece out into 8-inch rounds.</li>

        <li>Cover an oven tray with foil and grease the foil. Brush dough rounds with remaining ghee and sprinkle with kalonji. Cook one at a time under the broiler until puffed and lightly browned, about 2 minutes per side.</li>
    </ol>
