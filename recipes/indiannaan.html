            <li>Whisk warm water with yeast and sugar until yeast is dissolved. Cover and let stand in a warm place for 10 minutes.</li>
    
            <li>Sift flour and salt three times into a large bowl. Add yeast mixture, yogurt, and 1/2 of the ghee. Mix into a soft dough, then knead on a floured surface until dough is smooth and elastic, about 5 minutes. Place dough into a large greased bowl, cover, and let stand in a warm place for 1 1/2 hours or until doubled in volume.</li>
            <li>Punch down dough, then knead for 5 minutes. Divide dough into six equal pieces. Roll each piece out into 8-inch rounds.</li>
    
            <li>Cover an oven tray with foil and grease the foil. Brush dough rounds with remaining ghee and sprinkle with kalonji. Cook one at a time under the broiler until puffed and lightly browned, about 2 minutes per side.</li>
